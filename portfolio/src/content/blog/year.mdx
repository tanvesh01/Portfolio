# Cut down CRA build times by 70%

At the beginning of 2020,  I set out to redo my personal website.  I was fairly impressed with how I‚Äôd built it ([over-engineered](/blog/over-engineering-a-blog) and such), and also with how my blog post ‚Äî which was a big motivation for revamping my website in the first place ‚Äî had started to take shape. After months of work (and procrastination), I published my blog post in late November.

I crossposted it to [dev.to](https://dev.to/sreetamdas/the-perfect-dark-mode-2d7g) and [Hashnode](https://sreetamdas.hashnode.dev/the-perfect-dark-mode), and posted it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jywex9/the_perfect_dark_mode_in_nextjs/) as well. It also got picked up by [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/issues/217) and the [Stack Overflow newsletter](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/11/17089/#h-links-from-around-the-web)!

I'd planned quite a bit for its release, but that still didn't prepare me for the sheer number of people who read my blog post ‚Äî between all three platforms that I posted on, over 15 thousand checked out the post!

Here's what I wanna say to you ‚Äî if you've got _that one article_ that you've been sitting on for weeks/months, get it out there! You'd be surprised at how many people find it intriguing :&rpar;



```jsx highlight="10-21" filename="pages/index.js"
import { useState } from "react";

const IndexPage = () => {
  const [isDarkTheme, setIsDarkTheme] = useState(false);

  const handleToggle = (event) => {
    setIsDarkTheme(event.target.checked);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isDarkTheme}
          onChange={handleToggle}
        />
        Dark
      </label>
      <h1>Hello there</h1>
      <p>General Kenobi!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;
```
<CustomBlockquote heading="Fun Fact!">
‚ÄúI see,‚Äù you might reply, ‚Äúthis is because everything is an object!‚Äù Alas, this is a popular urban legend, but it‚Äôs not true.

Although code like "hi".toUpperCase() makes "hi" seem like an object, this is nothing but an illusion. JavaScript creates a temporary object when you do this, and then immediately discards it. It‚Äôs fine if this mechanism doesn‚Äôt click for you yet. It is indeed rather confusing!


For now, you only need to remember that primitive values, such as numbers and strings, are not objects.

## Became more active on Twitter

There's tons of great content on Twitter _if you're following the right people_ ‚Äî I realised that in a year without much physical interaction with people, Twitter is a great outlet for thinking out loud; I got loads of feedback and motivation from people. Heck, I even got a job interview just because I was following someone who posted about it! The highlight of it all was getting followed by [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/Netlify) and [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo)!

## Got a new job!

Late last year I [started working](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas/status/1326004455397969920) at [Remote](https://remote.com), a company that is everything I'd ever dreamed of. It really does "walk the talk" of working remote and async!

We also have a [public handbook](https://handbook.remote.com) that I recommend checking out! ([Our number one value is kindness](https://www.notion.so/remotecom/Values-d43475e8895c4b7c811490aef64782b3) üôÇ)

## A Year of Firsts

Working from home (for so long!) was a first for a lot of us, but in addition, I also:

- Got a [chance to speak at a conf](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas/status/1342839171287666691) for the first time (which got [postponed to March '21](https://reactday.in) üò≠).
- Got to [play in VR](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas/status/1336932419497197569) (thanks [@Remote](https://remote.com)!) It is one thing to read up and/or watch LTT videos about it, but nothing prepares you for the moment when you get to experience it firsthand.
